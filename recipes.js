Reduce heat to medium-low and cover; simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.\n\nStep 3:\nPreheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), and place 6 Korean stone bowls in oven. Combine shiitake mushrooms and 1/2 cup hot water in a small bowl, and soak for about 10 minutes, until pliable. Trim off and discard the stems. Thinly slice the caps. Set aside.\n\nStep 4:\nBring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add spinach to the water just long enough to wilt the leaves, and then drain and pat dry. Set aside. Combine cucumber and carrots in a bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\n\nStep 5:\nPreheat wok over medium-high heat. Cook carrots and cucumbers in a small amount of sesame oil to soften, stirring frequently. Remove from pan, and set aside. Add a small amount of sesame oil to the pan, and cook spinach in sesame oil for a minute or two. Remove spinach from pan,and set aside. Add the meat strips and marinade to the wok; cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid reduces in volume, about 4 to 5 minutes.\n\nStep 6:\nTransfer the stone bowls from the oven to suitable heat resistant surface. Brush each bowl with sesame oil to coat. Divide the rice into the bowls, and gently pack to the bottom (the rice should sizzle as you arrange). Arrange the cucumbers and carrots, bean sprouts, greens, shiitake mushrooms, and beef mixture over each potion of rice. Immediately before serving , add one raw egg yolk to each bowl, drizzle with about a tablespoon of sesame oil, and top with the nori. Serve Kochujang sauce as a condiment.",

      "Shiitake and Kanpyo\nStep 1:\nIn a bowl (or measuring cup like I use), put 8 dried shiitake mushrooms and pour 1 cup water to cover the mushrooms. Place a smaller bowl on top so that mushrooms will stay submerged. Soak for 15 minutes.\n\nStep 2: \nIn a small saucepan, bring water to boil. Quickly rinse the kanpyo in running water and drain. Rub kanpyo with 1 tsp. salt. Rinse and drain well.\n\nStep 3:\nWhen the water is boiling cook kanpyo for 3 minutes. Transfer to iced water to stop cooking process and squeeze water out.\n\nStep 4:\nWhen the shiitake mushrooms are soft and tender, cut off and discard the stem. Strain the shiitake liquid through a fine sieve to get rid of small unwanted bits.\n\nStep 5: \nIf the reserved shiitake liquid is not 1 cup, add water till you have 1 cup.\n\nStep 6:\nIn a medium saucepan, put the kanpyo and sliced mushrooms. Add 1 cup of reserved shiitake liquid into the saucepan.\n\n\nStep 7:\nAdd 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1 Tbsp. mirin, and 1 Tbsp. soy sauce to the saucepan.\n\nStep 8:\nBring it to boil and once boiling, lower the heat to medium and cook until most of liquid is gone, about 20-30 minutes.\n\nStep 9:\nCut the shiitake mushrooms to very thin slices and squeeze the water out.\n\nStep 10:\nSqueeze the water out from kanpyo and cut into 8 inch (20 cm) length, which is about the same size as nori sheet.\n\nStep 11:\nWhen shiitake and kanpyo have cooled, keep in the fridge till the next day.\n\nTomagoyaki\nStep 1: Make 1 tamagoyaki or dashimaki tamago ahead of time and keep in the refrigerator to save time.\n\nStep 2:\nCut tamagoyaki into long strips store in the fridge till ready to use.\n\nSushi Rice\nFirst make the sushi rice. Sushi rice is steamed rice that is seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. For 4 sushi rolls, you will need 3 rice cooker cups (1 cup = 180 ml) uncooked rice. Sushi rice should be similar to body temperature when you roll sushi.\n\nUnagi\nUnagi are typically already cooked/broiled when you purchase it. All you need to do is reheat in the oven. Set your oven to broil (high – 550F/290C) and preheat for 3 minutes. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray oil on the aluminum foil and place the unagi on top. Put the baking sheet in the middle rack of your oven and broil for 5-7 minutes (no need to flip). Cut into 4 long strips.\n\nMitsuba\nStep 1:\nTie the stems with cooking twine to keep them from being untied while cooking. Bring a pot of water to boil. Add 1 tsp. salt and blanch mitsuba or spinach just enough to tender. Do not overcook.\n\nStep 2:\nSoak the blanched mitsuba in iced water and squeeze the water out. Set aside.\n\nCucumber\nCut off the end and cut into quarter length-wise and remove the seeds. Set aside.\n\nBuild the Futomaki\nStep 1:\nGather all the ingredients.  Prepare Tezu (vinegar water for dipping hands) by combining ¼ cup water and 2 tsp. rice vinegar.\n\nStep 2:\nPlace the bamboo mat on the working surface or cutting board and place a sheet of nori on the bamboo mat, shiny side down. Divide sushi rice into quarters. Dip your fingers in Tezu, and put ¼ of sushi rice on nori and spread evenly with your fingers. Make sure to wet your fingers with Tezu when you do this. Spread the rice evenly; otherwise your sushi roll won’t look even when rolled.\n\nStep 3:\nLeaving about a ½ inch (1.5 cm) strip along the top of nori farthest away from you. You don’t put the rice till the end because after you roll, the white rice could come out from the seam and it won’t look pretty.\n\nStep 4:\nPlace the cucumber toward the bottom of nori. Front ingredients will need to go over the other ingredients. Therefore I recommend putting easy-to-hold ingredients toward the front, and put Sakura Denbu and Shiitake toward the top so the pieces won’t fall down when you roll.\n\nStep 5:\nFrom the bottom end (of sushi rice), start rolling nori sheet over the filling tightly and firmly with bamboo mat until the bottom end reaches the end of sushi rice on top. Use your fingers to hold the ingredients when you roll.\n\nStep 6:\nHold the top of bamboo mat with one hand and hold the rolled bamboo mat with the other hand and pull against each other to tighten the roll. Lift the bamboo mat and continue to roll. Place the bamboo mat over the roll and tightly squeeze. Continue to make the rest of the rolls.\n\nStep 7:\nUsing a very sharp knife, cut the Futomaki in half first. Every slice or every other slice, wipe the knife with wet kitchen cloth so that you can cut nicely.\n\nStep 8: \nThen cut each half into 3 pieces.\n\n\n\n\n",
